# Layout-Aware UI Generation

## Project Overview
This project generates realistic UI screenshots using rule-based layout logic and pre-trained generative models.

## Features
- JSON-based layout input
- Rule-based alignment and spacing
- Structured layout processing
- Layout-conditioned image generation
- Visual comparison for validation

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Diffusion Model (Stable Diffusion)
- ControlNet (if used)
- JSON Layout Engine

## Goal
To combine structural control with generative AI for realistic UI screenshot generation.
